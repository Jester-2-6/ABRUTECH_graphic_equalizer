# ABRUTECH_graphic_equalizer
FPGA based DSP graphic equalizer implementation

To implement the equalizer, we decided to use an Altera DE2 115 FPGA development board due to the existence of a sophisticated audio interface on the board itself, the Wolfson WM8731 audio CODEC. The audio signal was extracted through this codec using a custom audio signal parser. The extracted signal was then processed on our DSP logic, containing a pair of FIR ﬁlters, for preservation of stereo. The ﬁlters are generated on the ﬂy in a manner speciﬁed by the control interface and attenuates speciﬁc frequencies in the magnitude speciﬁed by the user. When the attenuation values change, the ﬁlter is instantly reconﬁgured to accommodate the new equalization. The result from the ﬁlter pair is then fed back to the audio parser, which in turn hands over the data to the Wolfson codec, which performs DAC conversion on the result and outputs the signal. Testing was done using normal music with a clear frequancy division, such as songs with heavy bass instruments alongside with high pitched vocals. For demonstration, a frequancy generator was used to generate a single frequancy tone and it was observed on an oscilloscope while changing both ﬁlter charachteristichs and input frequency.
